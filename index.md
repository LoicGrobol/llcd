The first workshop on Analysis of VAriation for BEtter Tools
============================================================

This workshop aims at exploring bilateral contributions between Natural Language
Processing and variation analysis in the fields of morphosyntax and syntax, from
diachronic and diatopic perspectives but also from genre, domain or form of
writing, without any restriction on the languages of interest.

We hope that this will spark a discussion on the types of errors made
by automatic annotation tools in the context of linguistic variation
(irrespective of the amount of data considered), but also on the means of
improving these tools (higher amount of data, better annotation with respect to
external dimension of variation, better modelling of variation…).
